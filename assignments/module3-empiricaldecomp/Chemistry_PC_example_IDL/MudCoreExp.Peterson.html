From Larry Peterson, MGG<br>
<br>
&nbsp; I might have a data set that could prove interesting for a class
to<br>
play with. As you may know, we have this nifty X-Ray core scanner in my<br>
lab that generates elemental data at high resolution on sediment cores.<br>
The end result is that you get a large excel file or data matrix with<br>
samples in the rows and elements (e.g., Ca, Si, Mo, Br, Fe, etc.) in<br>
columns. The elements themselves reflect different sources or<br>
processes; for example, the Ca pretty much all comes from the pelagic<br>
rain of forams and other planktonic critters from the surface, while<br>
Fe, Ti Al and others will covary because they reflect continental input<br>
that has come from rivers or dust. Elements like Mo reflect bottom<br>
water oxygen levels (redox state) and things like Br can be related to<br>
biologic productivity. So if you're looking for a data set where you<br>
can pull out things that co-vary and have different patterns through<br>
time, something like this might be useful to you. Besides, there might<br>
be something that comes out of your class analyses that we haven't<br>
picked up on! (The data set I have in mind is mostly unpublished).<br>
