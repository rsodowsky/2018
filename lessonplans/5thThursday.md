### This is our second Thursday of basic statistics.

1. Look over people's notebooks from last week: two favorite scatterplot or distribution plots, for YOUR OWN data, gotten from somewhere. It turns out there are still some technical problems, and netCDF format is a little bit subtle to extract the numbers from. 

2. Show (as slides) and assign a multiple linear regression notebook, with colleniear (non-orthogonal) predictors or terms in the postulated data model.
