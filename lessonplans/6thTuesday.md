### 6th Tuesday: last theory day in the Basic Statistics module

1. Hand out the take-home part of exam on regression basics, which is also a vocabulary list for the in-class mini-exam to be held next Tuesday. Emphasize that **orthogonality of decomposition** is the property we want to focus on going forward. Regression is just a special case of that. 

2. Look at the multiple regression notebook assignment. Clarify student work expectations. 

3. Show again the IDV, how to get data from it, and how to use xarray (instead of bare-bones netCDF reading) to get one's data. 

4. Find out how and why scatter plots are colored in the first notebook.

Scout assignments? Falling behind on this intention... 

Higher level approach to data access: xarray

Higher level access to geographic plotting and multidimensional data

But first, load them into the environment. I added them to

conda env _update_ -f MPO624_conda_environment.yml
